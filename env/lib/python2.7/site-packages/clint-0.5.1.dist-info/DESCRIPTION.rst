Clint: Python Command-line Application Tools
============================================

**Clint** is a module filled with a set of awesome tools for developing
commandline applications.

Clint is awesome. Crazy awesome. It supports colors, but detects if the session is a TTY, so doesn't render the colors if you're piping stuff around. Automagically.

Awesome nest-able indentation context manager. Example: (``with indent(4): puts('indented text')``). It supports custom email-style quotes. Of course, it supports color too, if and when needed.

It has an awesome Column printer with optional auto-expanding columns. It detects how wide your current console is and adjusts accordingly. It wraps your words properly to fit the column size. With or without colors mixed in. All with a single function call.

The world's easiest to use implicit argument system w/ chaining methods for filtering. Seriously. 


Run the various executables in examples_ to get a good feel for what Clint offers.

Example
-------

I want to indent my console text. ::

    >>> from clint.textui import puts, indent

    >>> puts('not indented text')
    >>> with indent(4):
    >>>     puts('indented text')
    not indented text
        indented text

I want to quote my console text (like email). ::

    >>> puts('not indented text')
    >>> with indent(4, quote=' >'):
    >>>     puts('quoted text')
    >>>     puts('pretty cool, eh?')

    not indented text
     >  quoted text
     >  pretty cool, eh?

I want to color my console text. ::

    >>> from clint.textui import colored, puts

    >>> puts(colored.red('red text'))
    red text

    # It's red in Windows, OSX, and Linux alike.

I want to get data piped to stdin. ::

    >>> clint.piped_in()

    # if no data was piped in, piped_in returns None


I want to get the first commandline argument passed in. ::

    >>> from clint import arguments
    >>> args = arguments.Args()
    >>> args.get(0)

    # if no argument was passed, get returns None


I want to store a configuration file. ::

    >>> from clint import resources

    >>> resources.init('Company', 'AppName')
    >>> resources.user.write('config.ini', file_contents)

    # OSX: '/Users/appuser/Library/Application Support/AppName/config.ini'
    # Windows: 'C:\\Users\\appuser\\AppData\\Local\\Company\\AppName\\config.ini'
    # Linux: '/home/appuser/.config/appname/config.ini'

I want to force color output even if stdout is not a TTY:

    $ export CLINT_FORCE_COLOR=1

I want to ask for input. ::

    >>> from clint.textui import prompt, validators
    >>> path = prompt.query('Installation Path', default='/usr/local/bin/', validators=[validators.PathValidator()])


Installation
------------

To install clint, simply: ::

    $ pip install clint

Or, if you absolutely must: ::

    $ easy_install clint

But, you really shouldn't do that.
