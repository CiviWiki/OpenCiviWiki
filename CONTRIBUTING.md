# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CiviWiki. There are many ways to contribute, such as by sharing ideas, design, testing, community building, and development.

The following sections outline common ways to contribute ideas, feature requests, and code.

## Creating issues

Make sure to search beforehand to see if the issue has been reported.

The issue tracker should not be used for personal support requests. Please direct those to our [live chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#CiviWiki:matrix.org)

### Bug Reports

Please try to have as much detail as possible when creating a bug report.

A good example should contain:

1. A short description of the issue.

2. Detailed description of the bug, including the environment/OS/Browser info if possible.

3. Steps to reproduce the bug.

4. Any identified lines of code involved in the issue or other insight that may help resolve the issue. This can also include any relevant error logs.

5. (Optional)Potential solutions to the problem.

A good bug report will help developers solve the problem without wasting time trying to figure out the situation in the first place.

### Feature requests/enhancements

If you have a budding idea or a feature that requires a more community-involved discussion, consider having the development discussion on the [live chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#CiviWiki:matrix.org) or create a thread on [loomio](https://www.loomio.org/g/ET40tXUC/openciviwiki). This will allow for a well-thought-out issue that will more likely align with the project's goal.

## Development

The following sections describe how to set up a development environment. Note we have tried to simplify our development setup to reduce barriers to entry.

### First, claim an issue

:warning: When contributing code, please make sure you claim any related issue before opening a pull request. You can claim an issue by adding a comment like "I'd like to work on this issue." Then, we will be able to assign you to the issue so other developers know which tasks have been claimed.

### Install Poetry with .env support

We now use Poetry for Python package management. Please follow the [Poetry installation instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) before trying the following steps.

Once Poetry is installed, enable Poetry `.env` support by running the following command. This will set all variables defined in the `.env` file when activating the virtual environment.

```sh
poetry self add poetry-dotenv-plugin
```

### Install requirements

Once Poetry is installed, complete the following steps to install all required modules.

1. Make sure you are in the repository root directory
2. Initialize the virtual environment with Poetry: `poetry install`

### Activate virtual environment

To develop the project, activate the virtual environment with the following command.

```sh
poetry shell
```

### Change into the project directory

Once you have installed the project dependencies and activated the virtual environment, change into the project directory.

```sh
cd project/
```

Once you are in the project directory, you can continue the following sections of this guide.

### Install pre-commit

We use `pre-commit` to run code-quality checks before every commit. Install `pre-commit` in your local project by running the following command (from within the virtual environment.)

```sh
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Run migrations

To create the (initial) database structure, run migrations as follows:

```py
python manage.py migrate
```

### Collect static files

Resources, such as CSS and JavaScript files, need to be served from a static directory. Run the following command to collect static files for Django to serve:

```py
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### Create a super user

You will need a super user to log in and manage CiviWiki:

```py
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Populate initial data

During the first setup, it's helpful to import hardcoded initial entries. In this case, there are two fixtures:

* Sample threads, located in `project/data/sample_threads.json`
* Sample categories, located in `project/data/categories.json`

Run the following commands to load fixtures:

```py
python manage.py loaddata ./data/categories.json
python manage.py loaddata ./data/sample_threads.json
```

You can also import all of them in one batch:

```py
python manage.py loaddata ./data/*.json
```

### Run the server

Once you have installed the dependencies, run the server as follows:

```py
python manage.py runserver
```

### Run unit tests

Execute unit tests by running the following command within the `project` directory.

```sh
python manage.py test
```

### Register initial user (optional)

Once CiviWiki runs, visit the front page (probably something like http://localhost:8000). Once there, click "login/register" and then "register new user."

## Deployment

The [deployment instructions for Heroku](https://github.com/CiviWiki/OpenCiviWiki/wiki/Deployment-instructions-for-Heroku) can be found in the wiki.

## Coding Conventions

We strive to follow [Django Coding Conventions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/).

## Compatible Versioning

We use Compatible Versioning in this project.

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make backward-incompatible updates of any kind
MINOR version when you make 100% backward-compatible updates
Additional pre-release and build metadata labels are available as MAJOR extensions.MINOR format.

### How is this different from SemVer?

Compatible Versioning ("ComVer") is SemVer, where every PATCH number is 0 (zero). This way, ComVer is backward compatible with SemVer.

A ComVer release from 3.6 to 3.7 is just a SemVer release from 3.6.0 to 3.7.0. In other words, ComVer is safe to adopt since it is basically SemVer without ever issuing PATCH releases.

### Editor

This project provides an `.editorconfig` file, with some style options such as indent.

#### VS Code

To use the `.editorconfig` file in VS Code, install the [`EditorConfig for VS Code`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) extension. See the [EditorConfig documentation](https://editorconfig.org/) for more information.

#### Pycharm

To use the `.editorconfig` file in Pycharm, enable the [`EditorConfig`](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7294-editorconfig) plugin. See the [IntelliJ IDEA EditorConfig documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/editorconfig.html) for more information.
