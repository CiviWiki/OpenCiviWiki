    # TextIOWrapper, as it's not from IOBase, so it doesn't have .seekable.
    # It does, however, have a mode, and we can cheese it base on that.

    # str to it, and it will encode it correctly for the target terminal or
    # whatever.

    # is a read/write stream, so we can get its type by reading 0 bytes and
    # checking the type.
